To implement a unified, piecewise Bezier-like curve similar to Serum's LFO editor, you should move away from predefined curve types (Exponential, Logarithmic) and instead implement a Breakpoint System.In this system, a "Curve" is defined by a sequence of Nodes (Points). Between every two nodes, there is a Segment with a Tension (Curvature) parameter.1. The Math: "Serum-like" Curve FunctionSerum's curves act like a Quadratic Bezier where the X-coordinate of the control point is locked to the midpoint $0.5$. This simplifies the math significantly, avoiding expensive pow() or iterative solver functions.We can use this optimized Quadratic Through-Point formula for each segment:$$y(x) = x + 2 \cdot k \cdot x \cdot (1 - x)$$$x$: Normalized input for the segment (0 to 1).$k$: Tension parameter (-1.0 to 1.0).$k=0$: Linear.$k=1$: Full curve up (Log-like).$k=-1$: Full curve down (Exp-like).2. Implementation StrategySince defining a complex curve inside every ModuleMapping would use too much RAM, we will create a central Curve Manager that stores a bank of global curves (e.g., 4 curves). Your mappings will simply reference a curveIndex.Step A: Define the Data StructuresAdd a new file src/curve_config.h (or add to module_mapping_config.h) to store the points and tensions.
